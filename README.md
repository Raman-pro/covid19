<h3>My one of the most special project</h3>
<p>During the start of lockdown there was a state wide competition in punjab ambassador of hope in which we have to create something to give hope to people around us.</p>
<p>I designed this website which showed cases,news through api and it had a checker feature which detected the risk by asking the symptomps of the user.</p>
<p>And surprising I secured second prize in the competition winning a laptop.</p>
<p>Here is the image:</p>
